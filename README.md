## History  

From sophwest: I've liked metal since I could enjoy music, thanks to my parents. In kindergarten, I used to run around the living room jumping on the couches while listening to Bark at the Moon and go wild for Chop Suey!, to paint the picture for you. The albums in this project are some of my top favourites from when I really started to form my personal taste in adolescence and my high school years, and thus hold a lot of sentimental value.  

From lightningstrike83: I was contractually obligated to include an album in this list. In all seriousness, I was happy to code this website for Sophia while adding in the one rock album that I hold near and dear to my heart. My Dad and I would listen to AC/DC Live in the car a lot when I was young so it was a no brainer to include it amongst this list. Plus, I can say now "I called down the thunder BECAUSE I AM THE LIGHTNING"
